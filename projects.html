                <p>
                    Spam classification using machine learning involves training a model on labeled datasets where messages are categorized as spam or ham. Features extracted from the text are used to train algorithms like Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines. The trained model can then predict whether new, unseen messages are likely to be spam or legitimate based on the patterns learned during training.</p>

                <p>Cloning a website refers to the process of duplicating an existing website's design, structure, and content. This is typically done by replicating the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to recreate the visual and interactive elements. Cloning may involve copying server-side functionalities as well, aiming to replicate the original site's features.</p>

                <p>First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) is a simple scheduling algorithm used in operating systems. In FCFS, processes are executed in the order they arrive, with the first process arriving being the first to be served.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/avinandan04/sorting-comparison-visualizer">Sorting Visualizer</a></h3>
                <p>Sorting in Data Structures and Algorithms involves arranging elements in a specific order, typically ascending or descending. Various algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort, are employed to achieve this. The choice of sorting algorithm depends on factors like data size, stability, and time complexity requirements, influencing the efficiency of the sorting process.
